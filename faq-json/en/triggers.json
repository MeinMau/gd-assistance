Use the wheel to select the new color for the channel. This trigger does not stack, meaning that a later color trigger can interrupt the change performed by an earlier color trigger. <hr> • <b>\"FadeTime\"</b> is the time that it takes for the change to apply.

Both of these tools can be found in color triggers, pulse triggers and channels. <b>\"Default\"</b> sets the color to what the creator set to be using the editor channel's menu. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/copyPasteDefault.png'></center> <hr> • <b>\"Copy color\"</b> uses another channel ID as reference. Toggling on this menu will open the HSV tab, where you can edit the HUE, Saturation and brightness of the color. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/copyColor.png'></center> <br> — <c>HUE</c> is the position of a color on the color wheel, measured in degrees. Setting a HUE of 30 means the new color will be located 30 degrees clockwise from the old color. For example, pulsing red at 180 HUE will result in light blue, which is the position 180 degrees clockwise from red. Negative values can also be used, with -180 HUE being equivalent to 180 HUE. <br> <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/hue.png'></center> <br> — <c>Saturation</c> refers to the intensity of color in a target, with 0 saturation being white and 1.0 saturation being the strongest perceivable color. The slide bar works multiplicatively, meaning the degree of saturation (or desaturation, if negative) depends on the original saturation of the color. It is also possible to switch to additive mode, where the degree of change can be ranged from -1 to 1. <br> <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/saturation.png'></center> <br> — <c>Brightness</c> refers to the darkness or lightness of a color. Higher brightness means less darkness, while 0 brightness indicates complete black.

This can also be changed to additive mode. <br> <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/brightness.png'></center> <br> <hr> • <b>\"Player color 1 or 2\"</b> uses the color of the player instead of an assignment. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/playerColor.png'></center>  <hr> • <b>\"Blending\"</b> toggles on a behaviour in colours that allow them to add it's values to other colours. Additive blending uses RED, BLUE and GREEN as values, each of these goes up to 255 of value. 255 RED, 255 BLUE and 255 GREEN results in white, while 0 of each will turn the color black, which is invisible.

The movement unit is 1/10 of a grid, so setting 10 units in the move Y box will move the object up by one grid. You can input up to 5 digits (or 4 on mobile devices due to keyboard bugs) in the Move boxes. Multiple move triggers can be used together. <br> <hr> • <b>\"Lock player X and Lock player Y\"</b> force the targets to move at the same velocity of the player during the set duration.

Stopping a color trigger will leave the colored object in the middle of the color change, depending of when this trigger is stopped. Despite this, stopping a Pulse trigger will completely undo the color change, leaving the colored object back to it's original color. <hr> • <b>Group ID</b>: The box where the Group of the triggers to be stopped must be inserted.

            "answer": "<b>Temporarily changes the color value of a given object.</b> <hr>The triggers offer many methods to customize these values, including the color wheel, the option to copy a different channel, HUE, saturation and brightness. It is possible to alternate between pulsing a color channel or a group ID.<hr> • <b>Color pulse mode</b>: pulses the targets to a established color.<hr> •  <b>HSV pulse mode</b>: pulses the targets based on value; <br><br>— <c>HUE</c> determines the color's position in the color wheel, measured in degrees. Setting a HUE of 30 means the new color will be located 30° clockwise from the old color. For instance, if you pulse red for 180 HUE, the new color will be light blue, located 180° clockwise from red. Negative values can also be used; for example, -180 HUE is the same as 180 HUE. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/hue.png'></center><br>— <c>Saturation</c> refers to the intensity of the color. A saturation of 0 means the color is white, and a saturation of 1.0 is the strongest perceivable intensity. The slide bar's effect on saturation is multiplicative, meaning the amount of change depends on the original saturation of the color. Alternatively, the math can be changed to be additive, allowing for a range of change from -1 to 1. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/saturation.png'></center><br>— <c>Brightness</c> refers to the amount of black pigment in a color. Increasing brightness reduces the darkness in a color, while a brightness of 0 results in complete blackness. The slide bar's effect on brightness is multiplicative, similar to the saturation slider, meaning the amount of change depends on the original brightness of the color. However, this can be changed to an additive effect if desired. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/brightness.png'></center><br>— <c>The Color ID</c> box, located on the right side, refers to a different color channel used as a reference. Setting a Color ID means the target will pulse based on the color of the assigned channel rather than its previous color. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/colorID.png'></center><hr>• <b>Target type</b>: Refers to the different IDs that can be used to target an object.<br>— <c>Channel ID</c> will pulse the change to a given channel, meaning every object that share the targeted ID will be pulsed. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/channelID.png'></center><br>— <c>Group ID</c> will pulse the objects that are in a group ID instead. Using this targeting mode will show two option boxes in the top zone; Base only and detail only. Toggling either will command the trigger to only pulse one of the two, for these objects that support them. Using channel ID targeting mode allows for the color change of objects that are not normally color editable, including triggers, portals, orbs and pads. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/groupID.png'></center> <hr>• <b>\"Fade In, Hold and Fade Out\"</b> customizes the behaviour at which the target pulses. Not setting a time in any of these renders the trigger useless. Fade in adds a gradient at the start of the pulse for the set duration, Hold maintains the final color pulse for the set duration, and Fade out adds a final gradient at the end of the pulse for the set duration. <center><img class='transparentBox' src='/public/assets/editor/holdFade.png'></center><hr>• <b>\"Exclusive\"</b> commands other pulse triggers to stop working if they all target the same ID. Using two or more pulses in a same target will mean that those pulses that have a shorter duration will allow these pulses with longer durations to continue. Toggling on \"Exclusive\" will instead prevent this, causing the target to go back to it's original color upon ending instead of allowing other pulse triggers to persist."

The Follow trigger will interrupt any ongoing trigger and will not stack. <hr> • Speed determines the speed at which the objects move compared to the player.
