Not all Moderators like to take level requests via DM, so try to figure out whether they have a server or a form if you are contacting them for this reason. Most Moderators also check their in-game messages occasionally. <b>Remember to stay respectful!</b> "

            "answer":"The only way to become a Moderator is through being promoted by RobTop himself. If you contribute to the community of Geometry Dash in positive ways, your contributions may be noticed by Moderators or Elder Moderators, and may be forwarded to RobTop. Beyond that, there aren't any clear steps to getting it. <b>However, this is generally what is looked for in Moderator candidates:</b><hr> - <c>Be nice.</c> If you’re known to be toxic you probably won’t get it. <hr>- <c>Be active in the community.</c> If you’re hardly present in the community you probably won’t get it.<hr>- <c>Be trustworthy.</c> If you don’t have any connections within the Moderator team, we can’t confirm if you can be trusted. One thing is important information that could be leaked, but if no one can vouch for you being trustworthy, how can we know you won’t just send a ton of bad levels or use your Moderator position to hate on creators? You’re a representative of RobTop as a Moderator.<hr> - <c>Be able to judge levels well.</c> We need to be able to confirm that you can differentiate a good level from a bad level."

Other factors, such as the length of the level or whether the song can be downloaded in the game, can influence the decisions of the moderators."
